<p><strong>Are Cable Machines As Good As Free Weights</strong>, We can build muscle comparably well with both free weights and exercise machines. This lines up with the advice that we get from top hypertrophy researchers such as Brad Schoenfeld PhD who recommends using a mix of compound and isolation lifts and a mix of free weights cables and exercise machines to maximize muscle growth. Like free weights you can still perform a fairly wide range of exercises on a cable machine.</p>

You can increase strength increase muscle get in shape become leaner have more endurance and look better using either free weights or machines. There might be a slight advantage with free weights with mTOR activation because free weights are often better at overloading the muscles in the stretched position.
