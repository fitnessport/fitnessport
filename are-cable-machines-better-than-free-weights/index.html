<p>Nothing wrong with machines but Id always go for a squat over a leg press. So if your goal is to achieve maximum hypertrophy and place your muscles under as much tension as possible on each exercise you perform in the gym these are the 7 common free weight exercises that are actually best performed using cables.

Nothing wrong with machines but Id always go for a squat over a leg press. Free weights dont have such limitations. Like free weights you can still perform a fairly wide range of exercises on a cable machine. But as a general rule I think that freeweights are better. Titanium Strength Dual Adjustable Pulley.</p>
