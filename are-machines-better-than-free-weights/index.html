<p>In my neighborhood there are few commercial gyms. Heres a summary of what these free weights vs machines studies found Cotterman The squat 1RM was greater for the Smith Machine than the free weights however the bench 1RM was greater for free weights than the Smith Machine. Allow me to explain what I have learned. You can more easily compensate with free weights With a machine the path is pre-determined and cant change. Machines are far superior to free weights due to the fact that you dont have a specific zone in which you are actually working the desired muscles. Free Weights Vs Machines What Should You Use Workout Machines Free Weights No Equipment Workout.</p>
