<p>I was looking at smith machines and they seems to have the best of both worlds safety of home gym but not stabalized weights at least I hope. Also the Smith Machine does awesome with isolating the muscles as well. Youve probably heard it plenty of times free weights are way. Both free weights and machines are beneficial.

<p>Youve probably heard it plenty of times free weights are way. In another study overall muscle activation was 43 higher with the barbell squat than the Smith machine squat. I think technically the advantage of free weights is that other muscle groups come into play to hold you steady etc but personally I do prefer the smith machine over bb. The smith machine is definitely safer then free weights. Free-weight presses also allow for a more natural arc of movement as you press the weight overhead.
