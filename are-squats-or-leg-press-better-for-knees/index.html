<p>Squats are a great exercise to add to your workouts and can be perfectly safe and healthy. It is another kind of leg press but it is performed in an angle of 45 degrees. According to fitness instructors while performing a squat your knees should form a 90-degrees angle because that reduces the unwanted strain on your knees.
