YES a rowing machine does a good job when your primary goal of exercising is trimming the excess belly fat. Try sliding an inch or two forward or backward on the seat. While a rowing exercise machine will indeed make your lower body more toned and gain muscle for you to gain bulk is unlikely without weight training combined and a calorie surplus. I like the rowing machine but am afraid it will make my already bigger upper body bigger.</p>
