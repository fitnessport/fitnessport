<p>I also have another post you can read called 3 Reasons Why Training Arms is a Waste of Time. Yes training shoulders and back muscles on the same day is safe. Insert pull-day workouts back or biceps legs or rest days to allow ample recovery time for muscle recovery. Normally people do back and biceps on the same day but its hard for me. Bench press incline press dumbbell press. 3 Simple Workouts You Can Do At Home In Less Than 15 Minutes Easy Workouts At Home Workouts Workout Routine.</p>

<p>Hang from an elevated bar with an underhand slightly-closer-than-shoulder-width grip. Again this is just an example. Its perfectly fine to train the same muscle group or perform the same exercises multiple days in a row. If arms are important to you then working them twice a week is ok but always start each workout with your heavy compound lifts like squats rows benchpress etc and use isolation work like curls to finish. This is especially so if you have a rest day after Shoulders. Pin On Get Fit.</p>

<p>I think both approaches have their proscons. Its best to avoid training biceps within 48 hours of your back workout so as to not be working biceps on consecutive days. Just make sure to mix things up. Its perfectly fine to train the same muscle group or perform the same exercises multiple days in a row. Its all pushing or pressing exercises.
