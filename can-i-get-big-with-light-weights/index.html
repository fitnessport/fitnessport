<p>Luckily a study out of Japan has shown that you can still keep your muscular gainsand even make some morewith light weights. On the other side doing exercises like spider curls and strict dumbbell curls with lighter weights are more isolated movements and involve a more focused attack on developing the mind muscle connection with the muscle you are working. You can do it with light to medium dumbbells. However the light weights will never promote growth because the stress on the body is too little. The pump is nothing more than blood rushing into the muscles an effect that can be achieved with extremely light weights.
