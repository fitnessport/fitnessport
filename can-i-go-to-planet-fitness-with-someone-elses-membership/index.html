<p>It may or may not have a 12-month commitment most clubs do. Or Can my wife use my Planet Fitness black card. I actually belong to 2 gyms - a local big gym with a pool and lots of classes and Planet Fitness. Your membership card cant be used by anyone else. No Planet Fitness does not offer student discounts.

<p>You will get a Planet Fitness membership online. You can get the other persons account deactivated. With the classic 10 or 15 memberships you would be able to access any location for the day with a 5 franchise fee. A gym membership for 10 a month seems too good to be true especially when gyms down the street charge 3 5 times as much but is it. Go ahead and fill out that form and sign it.
