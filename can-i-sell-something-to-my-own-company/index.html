<p>Selling equipment to a business that you are not associated with is different than selling to a business that you own. On the other hand if you dont tell them you are doing this youll be fine - however youll always have the risk if you decide to tell them so you can sell it to them. You do not need to be a businessperson to have an awesome concept for an enterprise and you also do not need to start an enterprise to profit from an awesome concept. Its called work for hire. Make it look like a full product or service and sell it.
