<p>The key to getting optimal results from your arm and shoulder workout is to plan. Because the muscle groups dont operate individually. Here are just some of the examples of training splits. Theyre non-competing muscle groups meaning that shoulder exercises wont fatigue your arm muscles and vice versa.

<p>The idea behind doing ChestBis together and BackTris together is that you use your Biceps as a secondary muscle for Back day and Triceps as secondary on Chest dayBy splitting them up you are about to get more out of each muscle group. Working out Chest and Biceps on the same day may seem odd to some of you. For instance you may want to pair your shoulders and arms together since many exercises such as rows use both body parts. The program is broken down into two distinct sections for your shoulders and arms. Yes putting shoulders and back on the same day of training can be effective but the order you do it depends on what your training goals are.
