<p>So it would be best if you do it site days but you can try and incorporate should and triceps on one day and biceps on some other days. A typical two-day split for example works your lower body one day and upper body the next day. Personally i do 3-4 sets of seated dumbbell press and 3-4 sets of upright rows on my armshoulder day before moving on to triceps and hitting biceps last but I also have almost an entire workout dedicated to shoulders on my chest dayinclince db press is the only chest exercise I have on those days since my delts are lagging and my chest grows pretty easily so. For example on day one the workout is mostly chest and shoulders and less volume on biceps. The trick is in distributing the intensity by doing the body part with more volume first.
