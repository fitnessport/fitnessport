<p>Answer 1 of 8. Aerobic exercise like running is thought to build muscle by inhibiting proteins that interfere with muscle growth and decreasing muscle protein breakdown MPB. Going for a quick run is another way you can build muscle without lifting weights. You can build big mass and muscles while also ensuring you are weight training for weight loss. You just have to incorporate the proper number of reps sets and rest periods and have the dedication to commit to a solid nutrition program.

<p>However free weights allow you to move naturally which is best for building muscle and avoiding injury. Similar exercises can be done with free weights once youve built up some strength stamina and balance. Then gradually increase your repetitions over a few weeks. You can still build muscle with machines and at a similar speed to if you were using free weights. Even if you dont have weights at home you can still gain muscle with some simple strength-training exercises.
