<p>So in general low reps with heavy weight tends to increase muscle mass while high reps with light weight increases muscle endurance. Strength comes from cell density the more things you pack into your muscle cells like glycogen for example helps you get more energy per cell which increases the weight you can lift this is achieved with low reps since it doesnt stimulate muscle growth in the same way as high reps but produces levels of chemicals that increase density. High reps with lower weights a couple of times a week is the answer He encourages injured athletes and weekend warriors to engage in this type of strength training to help build the muscles. A lot of young lifters girls and an equal number of trainers often ask me the same question. For example extremely heavy weight or high-intensity movements. Pin On Men Health.</p>
