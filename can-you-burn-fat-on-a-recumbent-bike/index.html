<p>There are customers that talk about losing weight in their reviews and answering other peoples question with the help of their recumbent exercise bikes. A recumbent bike &ndash; stationary or outdoor &ndash; has a back rest to support your back in a reclined position and the pedals are out in front of your body rather than below it. On average an individual can burn 210 calories for a moderate intensity 30 minutes ride on a recumbent bike which can make a great contribution to an overall weight loss goal. While you can typically burn between 400 and 650 calories per hour on a recumbent bike you can usually burn a little more on an upright bike. This means less pressure on your joints all the while allowing you to get a good cardio workout.
