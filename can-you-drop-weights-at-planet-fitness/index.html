<p>Yes you can lose weight from doing the circuit if you do the program at least three days a week. And i wasnt really making that much noise i felt. In most gyms dropping throwing or slamming weights on the ground is often frowned upon. The answer to this is yes and no. At Planet Fitness it can potentially increase peoples risk of injury.

<p>You cant drop your weights or grunt. To top it all they offer free Tootsie rolls pizzas and bagels every now and then that makes you wonder if its a gym or a social gathering club. Theyll kick you out if you dont stop these things. Because of this muscles other than the ones you are targeting with the free weights become engaged and ultimately more powerful. Theres an alarm that sounds if you do. Pin On Gym Soundproofing.</p>
