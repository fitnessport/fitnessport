<p>Create a daily calorie deficit and eat enough protein and its possible to lose fat AND get stronger in your first month. Weight is only one metric you should be following. Just curious I have pretty bad knees so most cardio activities are out for me but I was wondering as I 24F am looking lose about 20kg if that would be a way I could work around the cardio aspect by just lifting weights. Bottom line lifting weights on its own wont make you lose weight. How much weight should I lose Mind Mood More.
