<p>Gluten is the defining characteristic of wheat. The FDA recently proposed draft GF standards for the first time which are based on final gluten content. The wheat started out life with a normal 75000 ppm parts per million of gluten but after the sourdough fermentation process gluten levels were only 12 ppm. Some GF foods in Europe are even based on wheat-starch which though processed to remove gluten contains gluten residues.
