<p>When you join Planet Fitness you can pay a flat fee of 10 a month and have access to all of the weight training and cardio equipment in the gym on a daily basis. Level 2 2 yr. Although there are locker rooms at Planet Fitness you cant have a permanent locker as your own. My local Planet Fitness charged no initiation fee and was only 10 a month a bare-bones affair with no towels toiletries or a juice. Being able to shower at the gym is great for commuters on their way to work of course but its also been shown to aid in muscle recovery and help you have better workouts in the future.
