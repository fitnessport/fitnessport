<p>As a good rule of thumb you can perform 10-12 sets for the chest back thighs hamstrings and shoulders. Abs calves biceps and triceps can be trained with 6-8 sets. No muscles are ever worked out all on their own. But it was wrong for me and let me tell you why.

<p>Lets look at an example of how you can construct a Full Body Training Routine. Performing fewer sets per session at a higher frequency will likely be sufficient for increasing muscle size while also limiting fatigue to allow for higher frequencies and thus more frequent stimulations of muscle protein synthesis. Abs calves biceps and triceps can be trained with 6-8 sets. This means if you are doing bench presses for chest as an example you are also training some triceps and front delts. In a full-body routine you train every major muscle in your body like your chest back arms hamstrings and abs in each workout.
