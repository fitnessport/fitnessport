<p>It is fine to do triceps and biceps on seperate days. You can train your chest and shoulder together Monday legs on Tuesday back and core on Thursday and Arms on Friday. Because in Chest workout you also use your triceps. Frequency-wise three days on and one day off is good for mass gains. However the arms are involved in all upper-body compound lifts presses rows pulls so the direct arm work doesnt need to all be done in one day.

<p>Fatigue can break down your posture and technique in a hurry. You could in theory train Legs Chest Back and have two days for Arms but I think training should mirror body function. So as you can see the triceps muscle does NOT always participate in chest work. In this way youll target each muscle part at least once a week. It depends on your training goals.
