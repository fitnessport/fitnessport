<p>Shoulders and Chest Work Together. Id suggest a 4 day rotation Chest Triceps Back Biceps Shoulders Legs Abs Cardio. Insert pull-day workouts back or biceps legs or rest days to allow ample recovery time for muscle recovery.

<p>Yes you can train your chest and triceps together. So that is day 1 and day 2 out of the way next you dont have a have a range of choices I suggest that you train legs this is because your chest may still be sore and wouldnt want to train SHOULDERS on a sore CHEST and that your arms need a bit of recovery from the CHEST and BACK workouts. Rather think of alternating these exercises. Exercising the muscles of the chest and triceps together the chest and back on the same day or a back and biceps workout can strengthen these areas in a quicker amount of time. Your triceps are a much smaller muscle group that doesnt take as long to recover and that doesnt require big compound movements to grow. Pin On Gym Back Workout.</p>
