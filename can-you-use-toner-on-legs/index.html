<p>Johnnie Montgomery Answered Dec 6 2021 The best time to apply a toner is immediately after using a face wash both morning and night. Apply the paste to your arms and legs so that all of your skin is covered. The glycolic acid toner wouldnt work on removing existing acnebut it can help in preventing them by keeping your pores clean. Refrigerate your toner and apply to the under-eye area with cotton pads as a soothing cold compress. Sometimes the hair color you end up with is not exactly what you want.
