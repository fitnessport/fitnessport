If you want to kill two birds with one stone or in this case two muscle groups in one training day then you definitely can do that. You can do chest and triceps on the same day as they work in a similar movement. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>So its chest and shoulders not shoulders and chest And if you train triceps on the same day you work chest its always chest then triceps. Total body workouts are great for burning calories and are great for those who have limited time. The biceps would be involved with back and put to work after chest. Generally speaking it is not recommended to workout arms after chest day however this is not a hard and fast rule The validity of this recommendation largely depends upon your training level and your overall workout routine but just what do I mean. Fatigue can break down your posture and technique in a hurry. Pin On Gym Back Workout.</p>
