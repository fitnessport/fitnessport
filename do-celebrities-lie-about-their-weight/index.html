I think you shouldnt be using your own body as evidence that the celebrities are lying about their weight because 1 everyones weight is distributed differently you look like you have some muscle which means even if you weigh more youll look leaner than those of us with higher fat percentage 2 of course celebs lie about their weight or they may have weighed that.
