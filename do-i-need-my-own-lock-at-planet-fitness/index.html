<p>You can only use the lockers when you are there. Do I need to bring my own towel to Planet Fitness. Planet Fitness does not have towels you can borrow during your workout at any of its gym locations. You need a photo ID a copy of your checking account numbers and some form of payment for the initial fee. Planet fitness has a large locker room separately for men and women.

<p>You may bring your lock to secure things and after completing your workout just remove it and make it empty by taking all your things. The promise of 10 a month sounds enticing but what do you get from that. You dont need a voided check as they do not keep it. They also sell lockers for 1 year ago 5 each. A medium model is usually the best combination lock for gym locker usage.
