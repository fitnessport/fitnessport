<p>Stop to assess your legs from time to time. If you gave insufficient rest training will become counter-productive. Cycle for 30 minutes on your first day reduce it to 20 for your second and finish the week with a 60 minute cycle on the weekend. In truth if you are an active cyclist and you are taking a couple of weeks for the trip you might get away without any training at all providing you are prepared to suffer a bit on the way. All men should train their legs as the largest muscle group in the body there are a lot of secondary benefits to leg training that many people just dont realise.
