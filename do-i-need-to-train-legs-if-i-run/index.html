<p>I do no leg strength training whatsoever and Im still fairly competitive in my age group during race season. Testosterone is produced in your testacles a little from your pancreas and some is made in your adrenal glands on top of your kidneys theres not extra testosterone laying around in your legs that will pop up when you start working out. Yes you have to do Leg day. If you dont train your legs some of that lower body muscle will actually be transferred upstairs and your upper body will be bigger. Excellent options would be squats lunges and step-ups. Pin On Fitness.</p>
