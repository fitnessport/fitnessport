<p>If you CF 2x a week adding additional day i think would be beneficial. Of course since the goal of cardio is often to lose fat you do need to force the body to mobilize some fuel. Cardio is the most important exercising you can do in my opinion. However if you push yourself hard with every workout then skipping a day or two each. Increase distance by about a half mile every couple weeks. Pin On Abdominal Exercises.</p>

<p>Youre well inside the healthy range but can still add more to your workout regimen. Again just a handful of thirty-minute cardio sessions every week done after lifting or on rest days will do wonders for your performance and body. There is no recommended upper limit on the amount of cardio exercise you should do on a daily or weekly basis. But if your up to your 2 hours of cardio a day and you want to ease back into lets say normal life imo a good way to do it would be do cut down to about 45 mins a day and keep calories the same.
