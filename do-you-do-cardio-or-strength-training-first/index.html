<p>Strength training before cardio will make your workout feel more vigorous and cause you to feel tired. If your primary goal is to increase your aerobic endurance or lose body fat then you should perform cardio first. Similarly ACE-sponsored research shows that strength training before cardio increased heart rate by 12 beats per minute which can increase your rate of perceived exertion. Dont skip cardio altogether though as the aerobic portion of your workout will still torch more calories minute for minute than the strength training portion will. 81 views View upvotes.
