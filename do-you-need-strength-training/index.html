<h3 id="this-mistake-is-exactly-why-people-fail-to-reach-their-fitness-goals">This mistake is exactly why people fail to reach their fitness goals.</h3><p>But how much do you need in order to maximize muscle-protein synthesis. Many factors contribute to decreasing your risk of injury but having strong muscles is one of the best strategies to keep injury at bay. During strength training the stress that comes with pushing and pulling helps build stronger denser bones particularly targeting those that are most likely to fracture as you age. But if all you do is run you never develop the true high-end strength and high-power demands that you need to do that. You have to be able to put out more force in a shorter amount of time to run faster.</p>
