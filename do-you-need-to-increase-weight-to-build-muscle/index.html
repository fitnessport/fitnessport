<p>One of the most common areas of confusion among lifters is figuring out exactly how many sets one should do. Powerlifters commonly build their programs around sets of threes and fives because using maximum loads for just one rep is a measure of strength not the best way to build it. Pro bodybuilders using drugs may benefit from higher protein intakes. There are only a handful of exercises you really need to do to maximize muscle gain or strength gain. But that doesnt mean you cant build muscle if youre limited to bodyweight exercises.

<p>Sometimes nutrition is confusing. Maybe you didnt do burpees before or think its an exercise thats just for Marines and Navy Seals. You will do 2-3 biceps focused exercises per workout twice per week. A repetition is one complete movement of an activity like lifting a weight or doing a sit-up. I know all about that and have addressed both food and dieting quandaries in my posts about intermittent fasting hidden sugars and inflammatory foods among others.
