<p>Power lifters use low reps and high weight. High reps with lightweight train your slow-twitch type-1 muscle fibers and increases muscular endurance. While this study shouldnt be interpreted to mean that training with higher reps and lighter weights is a better way to build muscle than lower reps and heavy weights it does show that the range of repetitions you can use to add mass is a lot wider than previously thought. So can you build muscle doing high reps with low weight. Most research points to reps under 15 reps as being better for muscle building but other research shows muscle building can be equally effective with light weight and high reps.

<p>High reps with lightweight train your slow-twitch type-1 muscle fibers and increases muscular endurance. While high reps training is good for muscular endurance. As a result using heavier weights which requires lower reps is likely more effective for stimulating and preserving your muscle mass during fat loss. No this is just a myth. But this type of response as most short answers do comes with a little caveat. High Reps Vs Low Reps Which Is Better Why Infinite Fitness Pro Muscular Endurance Muscular Strength Muscle Growth.</p>

<p>If youre doing 10-12 reps make sure its the heaviest weight you can manage for that rep range. Intuitively there is no single best rep range to build muscle since sets of high reps and low reps have their place in any weight-training program. But high weight and low reps is not the best approach for building muscle. Heavier weight will build muscle density but dont rely on just that switch it up.
