<p>Falling for the common misconception that you need to do cardio to lose weight is one of the biggest mistakes you. Forget what youve heard about the ideal order of a workout. If you are planning to do a long cardio workout and also build muscle then you do need to start thinking about nutrition more. Why you should Weight Train Before Cardio. Its true that doing cardio first may fatigue your muscles and doing strength first may affect your endurance afterward. Pin On Workout Tips.</p>

<p>You can use weight training to lose fat and in some ways its actually better than cardio. 1 Warm up 2 Weights 3 Cardio 4 Cool down. To burn fat your body needs to consume. So in that case I always do cardio first. If gaining muscle strength and size is your goal then doing cardio before or after a workout does matter. Pin On Fitness Tips.</p>
