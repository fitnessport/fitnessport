<p>The muscles that work on a stationary bike Besides the heart the muscles targeted by the stationary bike are first the leg and thigh muscles as well as the buttocks or glutes and then the abdominals and back muscles. Hold the contraction for a period of 10 to 15 seconds then release. Increase the activation of your abdominals during a bike ride by consciously drawing these muscles in toward your spine. The more you increase the pedaling resistance of your bike the more you work your muscles and develop your muscle mass. For those who cannot ride outside indoor cycling is still resistance training.
