<p>Answer 1 of 7. I do both with and without weights. Squats with weights effectively stress about 70 of the human. To build muscle without weights you need to continually challenge your muscles by doing increasingly difficult bodyweight exercises just as you would use heavier weights in the gym. You can grow individual muscles by exercising them strenuously but theres no substitute for stressing large amounts of muscle mass. Pin On Exercise.</p>

<p>Its true that other leg exercises will build muscle in the legs but the squat holds the trump card because it works the entire body. This will break the muslce fibres down so they can be rebuilt stronger and bigger. I do both with and without weights. Perhaps the biggest benefit of squatting that most people dont realize is the fact that it can greatly help build muscles throughout your entire body. Strength training can involve some hand weights or just your body weightAs you get stronger and need more of a challenge weights will be your new best friend. Pin On Baby Gotta Work It Out.</p>
