<p>Resistance training is a great way to increase muscle density. Longitudinal training studies indicate that strength training and high impact endurance training increase bone density. Through working out and lifting these fibers must increase in density as they recover thus leading to that valuable increase in muscle density 2. However through a targeted total-body strength-training program its possible to not only prevent muscle loss but actually increase your muscle mass and keep your metabolism up throughout your life. Density training workouts can take many forms but they typically involve supersets or circuits to increase the amount of weight you actually lift.
