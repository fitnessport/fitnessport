<p>To do this supplement your StairMaster workout with two to three days of resistance training for 20 minutes per day as recommended by the American Heart Association to build glute strength. Stairmaster is great for LISScardio and endurance and heavy weights are good for building stronger and bigger glutes. Your entire lower body works to make that motion happen including your glutes hamstrings quads and calves. Really think about your glutes when youre stepping up and down. Using the StairMaster can tone and firm your gluteal muscles but will not bulk up your glutes. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>1 View Entire Discussion 6 Comments. As you become more comfortable on the StairMaster you can do glute exercises like single leg kickbacks while climbing. While stair climbing you can burn fat and build lean muscle mass while building strength in your glutes quads calves and hamstrings. Does the Stairmaster Build your Glutes. I mean it essentially works all the muscles in your legs from your glutes and quadriceps to your hamstrings and calves. Pin On Butt Exercises.</p>
