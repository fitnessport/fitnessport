<p>When running both feet are off the ground at the same time which requires a bigger thrust and more effort. The research is mixed and so its hard to know for sure if youll burn more calories running than walking. If you are running to lose weight keep in mind that you need to burn about 3500 calories to burn one pound of fat. Cardio doesnt burn muscle tissue as easily as many people believe it does as long as youre consuming an adequate amount of calories and protein. Research shows running one mile burns approximately 30 more calories than walking one mile and its true whether you run outdoors or on a treadmill.
