<p>So sure you can use hand weights for instance but you can also get similar results from simply swinging your arms a little more. The added weight helps strengthen your biceps if you keep your arms bent at 90-degree angles. If you swing your arms to shoulder height for 20 to 30 minutes you may burn up to 10 to 20 percent more calories than you would without the weights. Using 3-lbs hand weights provide only a slight increase in aerobic demand when walking normally at 4 mph.
