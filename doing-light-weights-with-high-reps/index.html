<p>Im not a big fan of training to failure. No shit thanks bro. It was a different story where strength and endurance were concerned guys training with the heavier weights saw the greatest gains in strength while those doing higher reps saw the biggest change in muscular endurance. We want to believe they work and only use them because were told so by so-called experts. When you do high reps with lightweight then you are training your muscles for endurance.

<p>That means doing the same movement for a longer time. High rep training with light weight is better for building muscle and adding size because it has been found to cause more sarcoplasmic expansion. High rep training can be the path to new muscle if you adhere to the following four steps. Lifting lighter weights with more reps gives the muscle tissue and nervous system a chance to recover while also building endurance. You can make the most of using light weights by targeting multiple muscle groups at once and this move hits everything quads hamstrings glutes core and upper body. Pin On Workout Plans For Women.</p>

<p>For example a recent study of resistance-trained young men found that light weight with high reps performed until failure was equally effective in stimulating muscle proteins as a heavy weight with low reps. People often use light weights and high reps exclusively when aiming to lose fat but this is a huge mistake especially if you want to have toned muscles because lifting weights doesnt stimulate muscles enough for fat loss. According to traditional thinking high reps are only. It also is less likely to cause injuries since the joints will not be under as much pressure and your form will be easier to maintain during an exercise. Dont you know when youre cutting you need to focus on doing light weights for high reps. Pin On Workout Plans For Women.</p>
