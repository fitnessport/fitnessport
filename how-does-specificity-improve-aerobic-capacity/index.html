<p>Aerobic exercise training can also improve muscle function and exercise capacity 8 16 23. Quercetin is a dietary flavonoid purported to improve human endurance exercise capacity. Specificity applies to the muscle group trained the speed of training the intensity of training the movements of training and the energy systems utilised. However most studies show that cardiovascular training requires a minimum of 30 minutes 3 times a week to guarantee increased aerobic capacity in about 8 to 12 weeks. Specificity when applied to resistance training requires that the muscle groups used in the sport are the ones trained.
