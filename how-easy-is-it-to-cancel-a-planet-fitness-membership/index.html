Planet Fitness makes it very clear on its website that you cannot call or email the club its subsidiaries or its parent company to cancel your membership. While we hate to see you cancel your membership if your club is open you can send a letter preferably via registered mail with delivery notification to your home club requesting to cancel or you can stop by your home club and cancel in person. If your club is still closed or you have other questions please contact our member services. Pin On Educatin.</p>
