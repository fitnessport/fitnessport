<p>If you have other questions please contact our Member Services department. Cancellation Process Planet Fitness makes it very clear on its website that you cannot call or email the club its subsidiaries or its parent company to cancel your membership. I move a lot for work and this has helped me see the nightmare of canceling with gyms. There are no ways to Cancel Planet Fitness membership using just a phone call or sending emails to the wrong account. The Planet Fitness Member Services phone number is 844 880-7180.
