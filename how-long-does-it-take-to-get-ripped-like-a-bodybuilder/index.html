<p>Crank up the resistance and work as hard as possible for 30 seconds then reduce the resistance and speed to an easy pace for two minutes. Add in medium-intensity and low-intensity cardio when your fat loss stalls. Include good fats from fish fish oil nuts olives and avocados in your diet. Few people ever achieve ripped condition so when someone does get ripped it gets attention and commands respect. Stay away from fried foods chips and other snack foods. Pin On Workout.</p>

<p>Dont be afraid of fat however. You get there by consistently creating a caloric deficit or burning more calories than you take in. Basically youve done your bulking for a few weeks by this point and your looking to get ripped for a contest or what not. You dont need to be so worried about how many calories that your taking in. You cant get Geordie Shore type ripped in 6 weeks and it takes you as long as much work you put in.
