<p>Unfortunately when your body needs energy it takes it from all over your bodynot just from your hips because youre sick of your love handles and those dreaded areas of fat. Tighten your abdominal muscles and your glutes and hold the position for as long as you can. Do daily to help improve your core strength and prevent pain when sitting. Pause for a while. Make sure this fits by entering your model number. Pin On Gym.</p>
