<p>If you are really trying to improve your cardio there is no rule that says you cant do your cardio first then finish with some weight training. Do cardio and strength training on different days altogether. It typically lasts anywhere from twenty four to forty eight hours from what it first makes its presence felt since itll take a little time for those affected muscle fibers to repair themselves. While it is not good to put your muscles through the same strength training exercises two days in a row it is beneficial to use your muscles to keep them from getting stiff and so cardio is a good way to do this. To burn fat andor lose weight you should increase the length of your cardio workout. Should You Do Cardio After Weights Or Before Best Cardio Workout Cardio Best Cardio.</p>

When it comes to slow and low cardio on rest days aim for up to a 3 or 4. Trying to do both at the same time will most likely slow your progress and frustrate you and may even lead to over-training injuries. A good form is essential for doing strength training exercises efficaciously and safely. Pin On Staying Fit And Healthy.</p>
