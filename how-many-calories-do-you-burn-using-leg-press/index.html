<p>According to my heart rate monitor i rip through calories when i do squats and leg presses. If you do calisthenic leg lifts for 10 minutes and you weigh 150 pounds youll burn about 40 calories. For a 150-pound person thats anywhere between 200 and 400 calories per hour. Those who didnt exhibited a 10-fold increase in fat storage compared to the fidgeters as reported at Science.
