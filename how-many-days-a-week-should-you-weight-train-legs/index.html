<p><strong>How Many Days A Week Should You Weight Train Legs</strong>, When you work legs you are putting a lot. Sometimes we can only give 3 hours per week to train. Once or twice a week isnt going to cut it.</p>

<p>Once or twice a week isnt going to cut it. Many exercises used to train these muscles are compound exercises such as squats lunges and deadlifts. So 12 sets for each muscle done once per week a total weekly volume of 12 sets.</p>
<h3 id="once-a-week-is-a-typical-bb-routine">Once a week is a typical BB routine.</h3><p>I would advise training legs at least 2x a week. So 12 sets for each muscle done once per week a total weekly volume of 12 sets. There is no reason that you need to train your legs 3 times a week unless its physical therapy and you are recovering from a serious injury. I never try and train a muscle thats sore. On those leg days include exercises that hit both the legs and the glutes hard such as Lunges Barbarian Split Squats and High Step-Ups.</p>

<p>And you shouldnt be training them any more often than once every 5 days.

Your sessions will want to be varied between 30 and 90 minutes depending on activity. As long as you can consistently get into the gym to train for those 3 hours and on a well laid out program youll do fine. In that area the answer is a lot clearer. Pin On Gym Training.</p>

<p>I never try and train a muscle thats sore. It would be counterproductive to have leg day 3 times a week if your primary goal is to slim down. On a typical bodybuilding split maybe 1x a week or with quads and hams split up into separate workouts. Depends on how many days a week youre training and how the rest of your program is set up. Training legs twice a week is going to take a toll on you and youll need those calories to recover unless youre taking some kind of super recovery supplement or the other stuff but you still need to eat.

<p>I never try and train a muscle thats sore. If youre an intermediate bodybuilder. The idea is that you should train legs just one day a week. As a result you may only want to train your legs 23 times per week especially as you get stronger. You can use your own body weight as resistance for exercises like pushups pullups and lunges.

<p>Training Legs Twice a Week So now that we know that training legs every day and 3 times a week arent the answers to leg growth and development is training legs twice a week the answer. Recovery is actually MORE important than training or diet and many people often overlook this fact and spend more time sick or sore than they do growing. There is no reason that you need to train your legs 3 times a week unless its physical therapy and you are recovering from a serious injury. When we do a deep front squat high-bar squat leg press or leg extension were working our quads through a full range of motion and its the bottom of that range of motion that tends to be the hardest which is amazing for stimulating muscle growth. The optimal number of days to lift weights per week ultimately depends on your goals and your schedule but planning your training sessions ahead will allow you to get the best possible results for you.
