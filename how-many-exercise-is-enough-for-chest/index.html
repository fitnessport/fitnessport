<p>I am considering becoming one of those arms-bros well. For most lifters performing any more than 3-4 various movements can result in diminished returns excessive trash volume and suboptimal quality volume. But in my experience focusing on the major movements squat bench deadlift overhead row and going hard for a few sets 3-5 followed by one or two accessory exercises for 3 sets each is more than enough. As I have just explained rest is important and you only need 3-4 exercises max per muscle group per workout now the ideal rest between sets is 60-90 seconds and 2-3 minutes between each exercise. Be sure to keep your weekly training volume the total of your working sets for chest between 12-16 total reps.
