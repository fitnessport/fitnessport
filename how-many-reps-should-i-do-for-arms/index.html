<p>This is why utilizing different rep ranges for each part of your arms will be beneficial in the long run. For arms anywhere from 3 to 12 sets seems to be the correct range depending on experience intensity etc. If you always do 3 sets of 10 for biceps youre missing out on some serious arm growth. Do a light warm-up set of 15-20 reps and then move into your working sets. Below six repetitions lies the rep range for strength and above lies the rep range for endurance.

<p>So I do 3 sets of 5 reps for 3 different exercises per muscle group. 4-6 reps of compound movements at 85-90 of your 1 rep max. If youre trying to increase arm size you should be working your triceps. In bodybuilding regardless of the body part its always advisable to hit a variety of rep ranges and even rest periods. It is suggested that a mixture of the moderate 8-15 and higher rep 20-30 are used throughout a training program.
