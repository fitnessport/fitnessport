<p>Do a light warm-up set of 15-20 reps and then move into your working sets. I just re-edited with more info im just curious because when lifting a good heavy weight with correct form after doing 2 sets of compounds my arms are quite tired so maybe this is an indication to the limit then move on to the isolation excercise to fininsh them off with out too much overtraining. For absolute beginners 4-6 sets twice a week works best. The more frequently you train arms the less you should do per day. I typically try to hit 12-15 total sets excluding warmups for each part of my arm but Im wondering if its time to up the volume or to try new exercises. Pin On Alles.</p>
