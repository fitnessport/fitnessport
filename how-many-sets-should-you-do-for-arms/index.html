<p>How many sets should I do for the arms. Reps for increased muscle size. As far as biceps go. For absolute beginners 4-6 sets twice a week works best. It also means that if you can do more than 12 reps but simply stop at 12 thats not a true set.

<p>Despite DeLormes success with three sets many people argue you only need one set to build muscle and strength. Arms would only be 4-6 total sets since they are considered a smaller muscle group. How many sets should I do for biceps. For absolute beginners 4-6 sets twice a week works best. Firstly the answer is that you should try and do all the different kinds of sets and rep ranges that you can in order to get as many muscle fibers activated as possible.

<p>And lastly just always keep in mind that research tells us about averages. Each workout can consist of a total of around 15-25 sets but the number of sets for a specific muscle group in that workout should be at around 10 or below. The bigger the muscle the more sets you will do. If you train arms 6 days per week youll do one exercise per muscle group per day with only 2 sets per workout. Basically if you do lets say 2 sets of barbell curls then 2 sets of hammer curls both 8-10 reps and for triceps 2 sets of cgbp 1set of dips and 1 set of lying extensions all 8-10 reps would this be enough.
