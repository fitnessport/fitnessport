<p>How much cardio should you do. If you are already actively working out and in shape you should probably be hitting the gym five times a week. And for those who really want to progress youll have to ramp it up to 3 to 5 workouts a week. If your goal is greater endurance or burning calories try three days of cardio and two of strength training. So how much time at the gym is ideal.

<p>Basically its all about you. At minimum you need about 20 minutes of cardio at least 3 times a week. If youre a marathon runner then 35 times a week. From my experience anecdotal only 2 times per week is good for most people unless you do super high volume 12 sets per body part. How many calories will you burn. Pin On Workout.</p>
