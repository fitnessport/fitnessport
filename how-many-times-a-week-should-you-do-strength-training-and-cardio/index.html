If you want to work out five days per week and are working on both strength and cardiovascular fitness try three days of strength training two days of cardio and two days of active rest.

<p>Hard-training people with more muscle take longer to recover than less muscular people. A week how many times do you have cardio and strength training. In 1988 Graves et al 10 studied 50 men and women accustomed to strength training and tested them on 12 weeks of reduced training frequency going from 2 or 3 days per week to 0 1 or 2 days per week. Should you combine the two or is it best to do them as separate sessions on different days of the week. 1 hour of running can burn anywhere from 300-500 calories depending on the intensity of the workout.
