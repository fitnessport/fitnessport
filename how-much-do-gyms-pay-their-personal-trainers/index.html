<p>The downside with this is that the gym owner profits the most from the fees paid by clients for Personal Trainers eg. And as much as certification bodies like NASM want to tell you that their average trainers make 42k a year the reality of a personal trainer salary ultimately lies in what the gyms will pay as this is the most common career route. In most markets personal trainers can expect to earn between 850 and 1500 an hour with the difference again being based on location. A client might pay 50 for 30 minutes which goes to the gym owner however as a trainer you only keep maybe 10 commission on that 50 which leaves you only with 5 out of the fee. Average Golds Gym hourly pay ranges from approximately 725 per hour for Staff Member to 2073 per hour for Yoga Instructor.

There are about 30000 commercial clubs in the US and I wouldnt be surprised if the upscalepremium clubs or independent studios pay their trainers more than the average.
