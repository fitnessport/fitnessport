<p>The PF Black Card membership is available for only 1999 a month and also includes access to all 700 clubs in the Planet Fitness chain as well as use of massage chairs Hydro-massage beds and Total Body enhancement beds tanning 50 percent off all cooler drinks and the opportunity to bring a guest every day at. With that deal the company is looking to attract the occasional and first-time gym users. In addition to the 10 a month membership Planet Fitness also offers the PF Black Card membership which is 1999 a month and includes the ability to bring a guest every day at no additional charge access to all. Some of the Black card services done elsewhere would cost between 50-100 a month so Im looking at cost more than anything. 12 The Annual Levy Fee is an additional fee which will be due and is not the Monthly Membership Fee but will equal the then applicable Monthly Membership Fee.
