<p>Also you cant really compare the weight with free bar because when you lift on a smith you can push upward and outward against the parallel rails which makes it somewhat easier. The exact amount of effective weight left for the bar varies from machine to machine but its commonly balanced to start at 15 lbs. The counterweight reduces the weight of the bar significantly so that the starting weight varies between 15 to 35 lbs. In some cases the Smith machine itself has a counterweight that reduces the weight of the bar and often there is no way to know by how much. How much lighter is weight on a Smith machine. 93 Smith Machine Muscle D Fitness.</p>

<p>It either comes with a counterweight or its practically free-floating. Note however that one version Matrix G1-FW161 has a 20kg bar weight. My Smith Machine uses 2 of those giant rubber bands that people use to strap things on cartop carriers as its counterweight. For most the bar itself will weigh 25-40lbs if you were to remove the bar from the Smith machine thats how much it would weigh. How much does smith machine bar weigh at planet fitness.
