Underdeveloped gluteal muscles might cause the runner to lean his or her trunk forward. The majority of runners will get injured so it makes sense to prioritize injury prevention in your training. Intense track workouts often arent necessary especially in the first few months of training as the goal is on increasing endurance not speed.</p>
