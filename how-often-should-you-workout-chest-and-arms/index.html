Generally speaking working out your arms anywhere from two to six times per week is fine but it absolutely depends on your fitness level. If you train arms twice per week youll do 2-3 exercises per session with 3-4 total sets. I also suggest that the week after week six you take it fairly easy on your arms and train them just once that week before getting back into any serious training programs. You should perform 1-4 chest exercises per workout with the most optimal range being 2-3 different chest exercises in a single training session.</p>
