<p><strong>How To Check Weighing Scale Accuracy</strong>, Calibration Weights Test Weights To ensure that your weighing scales or balances are weighing correctly we recommend that they are checked with calibrated weights on a daily weekly or monthly basis depending on how important the measurement is to your product or process and what the implications would be if the weighing equipment. Use a Cut-and-hold schedule instead of a Daily Microtaper to reduce the necessity of trying to achieve extremely tiny variations in cuts. It is because the digital weighing machine uses chips and an assembly of strain gauges which help in giving accurate results.</p>

SCALE CERTIFICATION Purpose This instruction defines the general requirements for certifying scales by USDA graders. If on average a scale indicates that a 200 lb reference weight weighs 20020 lb then the scale is accurate to within 020 lb in 200 lb or 01. Using a calibrated weight traceable to national standards and as close to the product weight as possible check that the static scale is weighing correctly.</p>
