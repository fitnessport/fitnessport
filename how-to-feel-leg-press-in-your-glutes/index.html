<p><strong>How To Feel Leg Press In Your Glutes</strong>, Keep your back and butt pushed back. You should feel a leg press done from this position in your glutes more than a leg press which is done with your feet close together low down on the board and pushing through the fronts of your feet. Avoid locking your knees when leg pressing because this can result in injuries.</p>

Leg press works the quads a lot so its understandable you think your thighs are working most. However because your body is positioned below the weight the incline leg press puts more load on your spine increasing your risk for injury if you dont use the machine properly.
