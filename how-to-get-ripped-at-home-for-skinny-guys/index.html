<p>Allow adequate amounts of rest between workouts. If playback doesnt begin shortly try restarting your device. Do not start lifting weights until you can do 10 pushups in a row 20 sit ups in a row and 20 bodyweight squats in a row. I believe its easier for skinny guys to become muscular than for overweight folks. Muscles are made in the kitchen and not in the gym. Pin On Fitness.</p>
