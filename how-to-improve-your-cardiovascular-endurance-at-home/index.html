<p>Any exercise you do that increases your heart rate technically requires cardiovascular endurance says Prince. The term cardiovascular endurance gets thrown around a lot in athletic circles but not everybody knows why its such a hot topic. While all types of exercise can improve endurance some are more effective than others. Department of Health and Human Services recommends adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week. With the combination of resistance training and cardio training you are providing the required muscular support for longer runs or any other endurance activity. Pin On Fitness.</p>
