Now i have started on a fat loss training to shift the belly fat i have but to maintain muscle i do one day metabolic resistance training next day weights as heavy as i can lift with 6-10 reps for 6 days and have one day off. Thats as good a goal as any and if that is your aim science certainly has your back. Pin On Weight Loss Soup.</p>

<p>It is recommended to do 60 minutes every day to speed up weight loss and help maintain results. In addition strength training exercises are recommended at least twice a week. Repeat on the left side. If you want to lose weight or meet specific fitness goals you might need to exercise more. The solution is simple in the sense that you dont need to overthink it.
