<p>Power Walking For Weight Loss. If you swing your arms to shoulder height for 20 to 30 minutes you may burn up to 10 to 20 percent more calories than you would without the weights. However a 2002 study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness found that holding 3-pound hand weights while doing aerobics burned no more calories and resulted in no more muscle definition than doing the same activity. Pause and return your upper arms slowly to the ground. My best suggestion for increasing the cardio intensity of your walk is to try speed intervals and hill incline repeats.

Walking With Ankle Weights Do NOT walk while wearing ankle weights These are really hard on your knees during walking. If you want to add strength training moves carry a resistance training band they are easy to hang off a waist pack. Thats a great calorie burn for weight loss efforts. Use weights occasionally.
