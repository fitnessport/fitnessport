<p>This sub seems to have the mentality that you cant learn boxing without seeing a coach and going to a boxing gym. Learn the 4 must-haves to start boxing without equipment. If your looking to fully dedicate yourself I would say you must try and find a local boxing cl. Just look at Manny Pacquiao the dudes 41 and is more. I would say you first of all you are going to need a place to go perhaps if ur not taking boxing that serious find a boxing fitness club which is not for people who want to really try.
