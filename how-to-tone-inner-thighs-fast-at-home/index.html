This variant of squat will help you strengthen and tone the muscles of your entire leg. Squat as deep as possible to the left while turning right toes up flexing right. This exercise strengthens your inner and outer thighs as you work against the current of water to lift and lower your legs. Pin On Fitness.</p>
