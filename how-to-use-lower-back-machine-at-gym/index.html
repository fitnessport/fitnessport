<p>When you lift a heavy object at home such as a TV the correct way to lift would help functionally strengthen your lower back such as performing a dead lift with proper form. To properly use the peck deck machine sit back with your elbows at about 90 degrees on the mid-chest level. Its made from steel to reinforce it and make it suitable for heavy use. Apart from working just about your entire lower body in a single move this squat variation involves holding a dumbbell or kettlebell in front of your chest to keep your form in check and the weight off of your lower back. Bend your knees enough so you can grab the bar.

<p>Once in position lift your feet and letting them hang straight down. Your back should be pressed against the back rest and your feet on the lower supports. One of the problems with lifting weights or using exercise machines is that high workloads can strain the lower back muscles exacerbating any pain or injuries that might exist. Close-grip handles are better for the lats while you can also use a rope to gain better contraction. Keep knees above ankles back straight abs engaged and arms crossed at your chest.
