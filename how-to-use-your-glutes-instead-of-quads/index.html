<p>Not Just for Injury Prevention In addition to dodging injury theres another perk of utilizing your glutes while running. This forces more blood into the target muscle area and is better at stimulating growth. They look similar if you arent paying attention but according to Brett hip thrusts require a lot of recruitment of your quad muscles. It also interferes with your forward lean by forcing you to move your head backwards to maintain your balance. Just sit down and place your hands under each butt cheek.

<p>Also push your knees out as you rise or at the very least dont let them dip inward. Without doing this you will most likely be activating your quads during hip thrusts. Instead use your butt as you walk and lean weight on the heel part of shoe like I said a little balancing act use butt by squeezing each side as you take a step. So actively squeezing your glutes on that side interferes with the movement of your pelvis which interferes with your shift of weight from leg to leg and the ability to use your torso as a spring.

<p>You do not want quads to be very engaged. So during all your ballet classes try to feel each movement initiating from the glutes as this will help to stop using your quads. Pull-throughs and kettlebell swings just make sure youre feeling the glutes do the work when you perform them. Even with proper form it activates my quads too much so I dont do it. You do not want quads to be very engaged. Pin On Medical Educational.</p>
