<p>This is me doing 120kg leg press at the gym with sore as legs one set of 15 reps. A beginner lifter can perform the movement correctly and has practiced it for at least a month. But most guys dont get really strong muscular legs from this exercise alone. But the leg press exercise is still an exercise to be taken seriously. Leg press is a horrible test of strength.
