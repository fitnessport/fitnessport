<p><strong>Is A High Aerobic Capacity Good</strong>, As their fitness program continues however their aerobic capacity improves allowing them to exercise more vigorously and for longer periods of time. Starting with a higher maximum capacity means youre more likely to be able to hold a higher level of performance within that range than someone who has a smaller maximum aerobic capacity. The AHA adds that only 20 minutes of high-intensity aerobic exercise the perceived exertion level feels high three days per week will also maintain good health and help reduce the risk of experiencing chronic disease.</p>
