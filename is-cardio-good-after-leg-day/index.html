<h3 id="soreness-is-going-to-be-assumed">Soreness is going to be assumed.</h3><p>Is it detremental to bike after a leg day. If you want to work your legs out properly ideally you need to be training them specifically by doing weights squats lunges etc. But if you only have an hour and you absolutely have to do cardio and weights in that same hour then your best bet is to either superset or do your lifts first and your cardio training after. If you have the time to do two-a-days or can carve out extra hours in your week to make room for separate strength workouts and cardio sessions then you have no problems. 5 level 1 deleted 5y Because broscience.</p>
