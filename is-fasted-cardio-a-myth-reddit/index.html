<p>Another great benefit of fasted cardio is that for many people its just more practical to do. A reasonable calorie deficit. Burn more calories than you. The idea of fasted morning cardio is that youve depleted your glycogen stores over night and so your body turns to fat for fuel when you work out in the morning fasted. Fasted Cardio is Better for Fat Loss Before we address this weeks myth specifically lets get one thing straight - for performance alone it is almost always more beneficial to eat before exercise regardless of the modality or intensity.

<p>A short study of overweight women in a caloric deficit running either fasted or fed cardio showed no difference in weight loss. Doing fasted cardio will not ruin your gains but it really wont give you a fat burning advantage over non-fasted cardio. Studies show that while you do burn more fat during fasted cardio you burn less in the 24 hours after keep in mind this study doesnt examine total fat loss just where your body was sourcing its energy. Fasted cardio is the act of doing your cardio first thing in the morning upon waking on an empty stomach. The idea is since your body is running on empty it is forced to take from its reserve energy sources and here lies the highly debatable part.
