In fact fat utilization was significantly higher in the non-fasted group for up to 24 hours after. Even then the bodys energy system isnt pulling 100 from stored muscle glycogen but most likely splitting the energy between fat and carb. This is unless youre going purely anaerobic for you entire effort.

<p>The morning often suits running walking and cardio exercise rather than heavy weight lifting. Training fasted pulls from your stored muscle glycogen. Your body needs carbohydrates to use as fuel and fasted weight lifting wont produce adequate fuel or nutrients which can hinder performance and at worse cause strengthmuscle problems. Make sure you warm up before doing anything strenuous especially in the morning. Studies have shown that weight training while in a fasted state allows you to increase these processes which in turn allows you to burn through that fat faster. Weight Training Fasted Can You Still Build Muscle.</p>
