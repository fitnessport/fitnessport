<p>A typical two-day split for example works your lower body one day and upper body the next day. While training chest in some of the exercises theres some resistance on shoulders but still it is not advisable to hit both exercises on the same day.

I wouldnt make these a common back to back workout because it wont allow your shoulder muscles to recovery effectively and it may not allow you to do the maximum amount of weight you can do on chest day.
