<p><strong>Is It Bad To Workout The Same Muscle Group Twice In One Day</strong>, Now if you have read my post on getting bigger biceps with high frequency training youll know that from a purely biological muscle building perspective theres nothing wrong with hitting the same muscle two or even several days in a row. Jen Hoehl an exercise physiologist based in New York City suggests hitting larger muscle groups like chest back shoulders quads and hamstrings. Those are long sessions in the gym also.</p>

<p>Video of the Day Your muscles need time to recover so working one body part a day falls within this guideline. Day 1 - Intense leg workout Full weight Day 2 - Mild leg workout Half weight The reason I workout the same muscle group is to enable my muscles to react more aggressively. Well good news guys this is a total myth.</p>
<h3 id="day-1---intense-leg-workout-full-weight-day-2---mild-leg-workout-half-weight-the-reason-i-workout-the-same-muscle-group-is-to-enable-my-muscles-to-react-more-aggressively">Day 1 - Intense leg workout Full weight Day 2 - Mild leg workout Half weight The reason I workout the same muscle group is to enable my muscles to react more aggressively.</h3><p>For example combining leg and back exercises requires too much energy. Working a single muscle group at a time also burns fewer calories than a total body workout where you do more compound movements that work multiple muscle groups at the same time. For instance in a standard bench press the main mover is your pectoralis major chest muscle followed by your triceps and shoulders but also to some extent your biceps and some back muscles. In fact most fitness professionals will tell you not to work the same muscle group on consecutive days particularly when it comes to strength training. The upside is that when you work out the same muscle groups by doing the same or similar exercises multiple times each week you improve.</p>
