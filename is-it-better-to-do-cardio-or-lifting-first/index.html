<p>Freeman suggests that if you do choose to do both on the same day you should consider lifting first before cardio as lifting requires more energy. Another effective way to lose weight by combining cardio and lifting is to do interval workouts. By choosing to do the cardio workout first you will elevate your heart rate as well as your internal temperature and metabolism. To maximize the benefits of your leg day youll want to lift weights first and save your cardio for after your strength workout or do it on another day. But if you only have an hour and you absolutely have to do cardio and weights in that same hour then your best bet is to either superset or do your lifts first and your cardio training after.
