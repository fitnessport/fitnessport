<p>EPOC After a workout your body continues to burn additional calories up to 48 hours. The vast majority of gym-goers want more than just calories burned. If you spend your energy on cardio before workout you will feel less energetic while working out. If you have the time to do two-a-days or can carve out extra hours in your week to make room for separate strength workouts and cardio sessions then you have no problems. If you want to build more muscle mass you will likely do your lifting exercises first and end up with cardio. Pin On Askhseis Gymnastikhs.</p>

<p>EPOC After a workout your body continues to burn additional calories up to 48 hours. The bottom line is this. So I looked up some research and this is what I found. This is where the bulk of your energy will be placed whereas doing weights first will zap some of that away leading to. Doing cardio after weight training burned more fat during the first 15 minutes of that cardio workout versus starting with cardio and then lifting according to. Pin On Work.</p>
