<p>I love the way I feel when its over and I hate the idea of having to spend much time doing it. While you might not need to add variety to your routine each and every time you log your daily workout sticking to cardio only can have serious effects on your bod. There is no recommended upper limit on the amount of cardio exercise you should do on a daily or weekly basis. At your meals eat a varied diet of whole foods. These people dont have to do cardio every day. Pin On Fitness.</p>
