<p>W hile any time is a good time to work up a sweat there might be some perks to getting your cardio done first thing in the morning. Both are critical to your success when you work out two times a day. Complement your workouts with low-intensity activity and pay attention to your nutrition to ensure your muscles and nervous system are replenished. In fact its hard to find a better way to get rid of fat and lose weight.

<p>Specifically performing your cardio first thing in the morning in a fasted state will burn more fat during the workout than if it was done later in the day after you have eaten one or more meals. Do the cardio in the morning eat afterwards and then weights in the evening should be perfect. Personally I do my cardio AFTER I lift. You dont want to burn out or get hurt stop working out and gain the weight back. It will give your body the time it needs to refill fuel reserves.
