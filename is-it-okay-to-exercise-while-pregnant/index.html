Start in tabletop position wrists directly under your shoulders and knees under your hips back straight tighten core and slowly inhale and lift your left leg and extend it in a straight line behind you while you also lift up your right arm straight in front of you. However its important to watch your consumption of coffee and caffeine overall during pregnancy. Pin On Simple Baby.</p>
