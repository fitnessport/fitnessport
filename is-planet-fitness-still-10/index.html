<p>To start - Im going to walk you through what a traditional planet fitness is like. But in truth it is just like any other gym. Planet Fitness logged 135 million in net income at the end of 2019 but this sunk to a 152 million loss a year later as gyms closed and vaccines were in early development stage. I have compared them with the other fitness centers in the area and Im still a member. Ive tried several different gyms throughout my fitness journey including Planet Fitness Golds Anytime fitness school gyms and local gyms.
