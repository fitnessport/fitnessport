<p>While strength training can offer a similar benefit as weight and reps increase over time. Cardio fitness exercises come in many forms. To elaborate further your fitness health goals are two most important determining factors. While a weight-training workout wont burn more calories than a cardio workout of the same duration that doesnt mean lifting isnt worth your time. A cardio workout burns more calories than a weight-training workout. Pin On Work Out.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most crucial one to consider is that strength training is more effective than cardio at building lean muscle mass which then basically serves as a calorie-burning powerhouse in the body. Thus the ideal exercise program for improving body composition and health includes cardio and weights. Those who strength trained were less likely to have a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. If your goal is to lose weight combining both strength and cardio is your best bet. Therefore next time you ask yourself if its better to do cardio or strength training think about what you want to achieve and how to combine both. Pin On Instagym.</p>
