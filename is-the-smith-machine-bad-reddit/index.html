<p><strong>Is The Smith Machine Bad Reddit</strong>, The Smith machine is one of the biggest scapegoats yet theres little evidence that anything is inherently bad about a Smith machine.

Yes the smith machine can be used for things and progressed on like any other machine.</p>

For big main compound movements like squats bench deadlift overhead press they should be avoided as the fixed bar path really makes the movement awkward and just wrong. Deadlift is a compound exercise designed for engagement of all your muscles to pull the bar from the floor up and lock out.
