There was a higher risk of all cardiovascular-related outcomes in the T2DM cohort regardless of the age at diagnosis of T2DM with notable and consistent associations between age at diagnosis of T2DM and all outcomes analyzed where those with T2DM diagnosed at 40 had the highest excess relative risk for most outcomes with adjusted hazard ratios HRs.

Endurance training enhances the individuals ability to perform exercise at both submaximal and maximal intensities as demonstrated either by the ability to exercise longer at a similar workload or by increasing the workload attained at a given heart rate. After endurance training the mean decrease of RHR of the exercising participants as compared to the non-exercising was depending on the sexes of the participants 45 to 90 and 27 to 58 bpm resp.</p>
