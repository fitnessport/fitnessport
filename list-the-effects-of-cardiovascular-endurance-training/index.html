<p>This leads to non-pathological cardiac hypertrophy improved ventricular function and increase in the resistance of the heart to ischemic insult 63. Heart contracts more often increased heart rate. It is a form of fibro.</p>
<h3 id="cardiovascular-endurance-training-activities-help-control-several-heart-disease-risk-factors-including-high-cholesterol-high-blood-pressure-and-obesity-according-to-mayo-clinic">Cardiovascular endurance training activities help control several heart disease risk factors including high cholesterol high blood pressure and obesity according to Mayo Clinic.</h3><p>A 4-week endurance training program was effective in attenuating the paradoxical arterial vasoconstriction in epicardial conduit vessels by 54 and increased average peak flow velocity by 78 in response to intracoronary. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a 6-week circuit training on the cardiovascular endurance and quality of life of an apparently healthy adult female population. In conclusion aerobic endurance training decreases blood pressure through a reduction of vascular resistance in which the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system appear to be involved and favorably affects concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular endurance training activities help control several heart disease risk factors including high cholesterol high blood pressure and obesity according to Mayo Clinic. Reduced risk of heart disease.</p>
