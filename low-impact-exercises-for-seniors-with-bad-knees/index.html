<p>If you can walk you can do this. To get you started check out these strength training exercises to help you start building muscle after 50. The patient should perform exercises that put stress on the bones against gravity which will help increase bone strength and build muscle. Ive personally trained people over 50 60 and 70 years of age whos movement and strength is better than those of half their age. Stand behind a chair and hold onto its back for balance.

<p>I wouldnt recommend it for seniors who are already reasonably fit. No gimmicks or fancy stuff CONS. Our pick for seniors. Walking is one of the best low-impact exercises for older people looking to get fit and lose weight. Swimming is a low-impact exercise thats easy on the joints according to Harvard Health Publishing.
