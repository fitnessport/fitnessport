<p><strong>Should Cardio Have Its Own Day</strong>, While cardio can be a little uncomfortable at times it should not cause you physical pain. You should always have at least one day a week where you do absolutely nothing though so that your body has a chance to keep up and fully recover. In total I suggest at least 10 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of resistance training a day.</p>
