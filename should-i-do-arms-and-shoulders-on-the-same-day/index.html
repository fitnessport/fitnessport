<p>Thats the biggest advantage of training your chest and shoulders together. I dont work my arms the same day as my shoulders i suppose you could but your lifts might be weaker on your arms if you just finished shoulders and vice versa. I said Why Chest and Tricep not Chest and Arms or Chest and Back. For example dont train chest on Mondays shoulders on Tuesdays and triceps on Wednesdays.

If you do have an arm day make sure it always comes either the day before a rest day or the day before a leg day.
