<p>GOOD to do cardio everyday. Doing the same amount of cardio every day can inhibit your recovery causing you to lose muscle over time. Most people might say if can do actual HIT cardio everyday then the intensity isnt high enough. Adding cardio to my routine would have meant I needed to consume even more calories per day which would be close to impossible especially if you are someone who struggles to gain weight For that reason I recommend you do minimal cardio outside of normal activities of daily living if you are someone who struggles to gain weight. Doing 30 minutes of cardio every day should definitely be considered if youre having trouble staying focused during long lectures at school or while plowing through a mountain of paperwork at your job.
