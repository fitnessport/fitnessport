<p>A Word From Verywell Ultimately you should exercise at whatever time you feel most comfortable with and can manage while also considering all personal factors. This means you spend less time but not no time warming up and have a lower risk of injury. If you can be active only morning and evening then strength training in the morning and lite steady cardio in the eveningnight. Some friends of mine will get up early and run though then do weights in the afternoon. Then in the afternoon after work I will be doing weight training.

<p>In other words if you can lift weights in the morning and do cardio at night or vice versa youll make a lot more progress. This schedule seems to work best if you work a typical day shift and sleep during the overnight hours. From the perspective of fat burning most would find that an evening workout can be just as effective as a brisk morning cardio session. Your heart and muscles are already warmer and more prepared for exercise than they are in the morning. Youre Doing Too Much Cardio. Pin On Eat Well All Of Fall.</p>
