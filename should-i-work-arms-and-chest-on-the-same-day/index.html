From one day to another we went from doing 2 regular chest workouts a week to doing 5 to 6 effectively hitting chest on every gym day. The biceps would be involved with back and put to work after chest. We of course decided to start out safe cutting our volume to about 13rd of a regular chest workout. Working shoulders and triceps on the same day is underrated imo.

<p>So that is day 1 and day 2 out of the way next you dont have a have a range of choices I suggest that you train legs this is because your chest may still be sore and wouldnt want to train SHOULDERS on a sore CHEST and that your arms need a bit of recovery from the CHEST and BACK workouts. About half-way through your chest and back workout youre going to feel super pumped. So that is day 1 and day 2 out of the way next you dont have a have a range of choices I suggest that you train legs this is because your chest may still be sore and wouldnt want to train SHOULDERS on a sore CHEST and that your arms need a bit of recovery from the CHEST and BACK workouts.

<p>In short no more than 5 sets of 5 reps on squats and 1 set of 5 reps on the deadlift. This is why I believe workout shoulders and arms on the same day is a great combination. I devote an entire day to chest and abs and really feel like the extra attention has made a noticeable difference. Generally speaking it is not recommended to workout arms after chest day however this is not a hard and fast rule The validity of this recommendation largely depends upon your training level and your overall workout routine but just what do I mean. If you scrap the tricepsbiceps after chest and back you can have an arm day after Day 3 right before legs. 10 Best Chest Exercises For Building Muscle Gymguider Com Best Chest Workout Chest Workouts Gym Workout Tips.</p>
