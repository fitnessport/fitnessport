<p>You can train arms between 2-6 times per week. Ive spoken to girls online albeit from other countries. As per the info youve provided youre doing 2 things wrong.

If you can train your arms for longer than 30 minutes about 12-15 sets you probably didnt work them hard enough. 6 Exercises For Insanely Ripped Summer Ab Gains Part 1 Gymguider Com Abs Workout Workout 30 Day Ab Workout.</p>
