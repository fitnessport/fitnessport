<p>Overall cardio does not necessarily help to build muscle in the way that strength training does. Cardio burns calories which is good if youre trying to lose weight but in order to have any sort of muscular growth you need to be eating at a caloric surplus meaning you have to eat more calories than you burn. In this article Ill share with you my journey of doing cardio and sports while trying to gain enough weight to break out of my skinny boy.</p>
<h3 id="the-short-answer-is-yes">The short answer is yes.</h3><p>It just means that you need to perform cardio that minimally impacts the resources necessary to build muscle. Cycling at a low-to-moderate intensity for 20-30 minutes the day after a heavy leg workout for example will often reduce post-exercise muscle soreness and may accelerate the rate at which muscle damage is repaired. You should continue to do cardio since it is essential for your health. Overall cardio does not necessarily help to build muscle in the way that strength training does. Exclusively doing cardio will not give you a nice muscular body.</p>
