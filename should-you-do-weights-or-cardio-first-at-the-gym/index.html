Should You Do Cardio Before Or After Weights After Workout Workout Best Cardio Workout From in.pinterest.com</p>
<p>Ryan Fairman ACSM-certified personal trainer echoed that statement. Which Should I Do First. Lifting weights first especially if you are lifting heavy using your entire body will tire you out before you make it to the cardio portion of your workout.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-do-cardio-maximum-3-days-a-week-and-that-too-after-you-complete-strength-training">You can do cardio maximum 3 days a week and that too after you complete strength training.</h3><p>But if you only have an hour and you absolutely have to do cardio and weights in that same hour then your best bet is to either superset or do your lifts first and your cardio training after. If you have the time to do two-a-days or can carve out extra hours in your week to make room for separate strength workouts and cardio sessions then you have no problems. Of course doing cardio first also means you end up with less energy for your workout. If your goal is overall weight loss you might do cardio first to maximize your workout time. Youve started a new fitness program and this new program calls for both cardio and weight training.</p>

<p>If you do cardio first while you will be in an aerobic fat burning mode- your body will still use up considerable stores of muscle glycogen. Weights first- heres why- weight training uses your glycogen stores and has anaerobic energy requirements.
