<p>Simply finding the distance around your waist is also a good indicator of the amount of fat held around your stomach. Women should have a waist to hip ratio under 10 a. Your shoulder and hip measurements are within 5 of each other. For a woman with a very low fat to muscle ration or a very large ribcage and less bust waist and hip definition this usually but not always means a very petite woman the corset waist measurement should be less than 5 smaller in the waist. According to health guidelines your waist size needs to be less than half your height in inches and a waist-to-hip ration under 05 to be considered healthy.

<p>Your waist is at least 25 percent smaller than your shoulder hip and bust measurements. Oh your right thanks man. Keep the style rule in mind that its usually best to combine a lose fit with a tighter or more tailored top. By wearing waist-cinching belts you are leading all attention to the nip in your waistline making it appear smaller than it really is. You may find that even allowing for the extra ease at the waist you still need to grade between sizes for instance you might be a size 18 at the bust a 20 at the waist and a 22 at the hip.
