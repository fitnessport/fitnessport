<p>I dont want to start lifting at my 5RM or even a high percentage of it. If the weight is really too light the first workout bump it up by 5kg10lb the next workout. This way you have two rest days before your Thursday workout and three rest days before your Monday workout. For instance if my max on bench is 285 could I start on say 175 and progress from there. The only requirement for the starting weights on 5x5 is that you can actually do 5 sets of 5 at your starting weight.

<p>That would mean the first 2 and a half months are just EXTREMELY light weight. The only requirement for the starting weights on 5x5 is that you can actually do 5 sets of 5 at your starting weight. Even 90kg would be ill-advised. I only did dumbbell overhead press with 75 lbs for 5 reps on a good day. 10lb per month on your Squat is more realistic.

<p>Youll always gain strength faster on StrongLifts 55 because there the weight increases by 5lb 3xweek. The description of stronglifts 5x5 is also much more begginer friendly describing exactly what you do in all likely situations. Forget about boosting your Squat by 120lb in only 8 weeks with Madcow. Even 90kg would be ill-advised. If that doesnt sound much realize that its still 120lb in 1 year.
