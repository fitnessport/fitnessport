<p>But for weight loss I believe cardio is the least effective form of exercise. If you have worked your way hard to a skinny body and now want to gain weight in buttocks and thighs then you have come to right place. Instead it could just empty your wallet and upset your stomach. Just measure how much weight youre gaining each week and then adjust accordingly. If youve been taking too much synthroid not only will you likely feel like an anxious sleepless maniac but youll probably shed more body weight than expected. Pin On Abs.</p>
