<p><strong>Two Types Of Cardiorespiratory Fitness</strong>, Cardiorespiratory exercise types into three groups Group I Group II and Group III based on the skill demands of the activity. An observational cohort of 6249 women aged 20-79 years was free of baseline cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes. In this analysis investigators found that people who increased their steps per day participated in a greater amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or reduced their sedentary time between the two exams showed improvements in distinct aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness throughout exercise sessions from warm-up to peak exercise to.</p>
