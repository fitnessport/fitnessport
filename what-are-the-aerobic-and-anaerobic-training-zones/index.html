<p>But first lets look at what the different zones are. Heart rate zones are closely linked to your aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. When we talk about heart rate training zones what we are describing and measuring is the intensity at which your body is using its aerobic metabolism system to produce energy from fat and glycogen. In this zone your anaerobic threshold AT is found - sometimes referred to the point of deflection POD. Lower training threshold of the anaerobic zone 80 of maxHR.

<p>Continuous steady state exercise is performed aerobically. The high end of this zone along with the bottom end of the next zone is what I referred to above as the grey zone. 80 of the total yearly volume focuses on endurance training whereas the remaining 20 is attributable to intervals and strength training. This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration. -for the aerobic training zone you must work within a range of heart rates-your heart rate at the limit of these zones are known as training thresholds-the lower limit is called the aerobic threshold -the upper limit is called the anaerobic threshold.

In order to calculate with the greatest accuracy your own heart rate hereinafter referred to as the heart rate of the anaerobic and aerobic thresholds since the training zones are built according to these indicators it is necessary to pass a sports test with a gas analyzer and blood sampling which will subsequently determine your personal indicators.

<p>But first lets look at what the different zones are. Workout length normally differs greatly between these two zones. -for the aerobic training zone you must work within a range of heart rates-your heart rate at the limit of these zones are known as training thresholds-the lower limit is called the aerobic threshold -the upper limit is called the anaerobic threshold. Steady is a moderate intensity zone used to develop your aerobic fitness and ability to generate energy from fat. Working out within your anaerobic threshold requires you to keep your heart rate within zones 4 and 5 around 80-90 of your maximum heart rate.
