<p>The clinical effects of endurance exercise training on coronary endothelial function were first studied in humans by Hambrecht et al 117. HRV measurements demonstrate a significant and progressive decrease in parasympathetic activity during long-term heavy training which is followed by an equally significant increase during rest. Cardiovascular workouts get your heart pumping blood faster optimizing circulation and oxygen absorption.</p>
<h3 id="your-body-is-more-able-to-use-fat-as-an-energy-source">Your body is more able to use fat as an energy source.</h3><p>The benefits of exercise are indisputable and understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory endurance training and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with incremented aerobic or anaerobic capacity. Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. Endurance exercise training exerts many positive effects on health including improved metabolism reduction of cardiovascular risk and reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Your body is more able to use fat as an energy source. Cardiovascular endurance training is often done to prepare for a long-distance race.</p>
