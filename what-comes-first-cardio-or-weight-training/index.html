According to most experts it is best to do strength training before engaging in cardio such as on ellipticals treadmills or indoor cycles. Or is your main goal to get leaner and lose weight or are you mostly concerned with improving strength. Alternate your cardio days with your strength training days to see the best results. For those who are seeking weight loss cardio should come first but if gaining muscle mass is the goal its time to hit the weight room first. Pin On Fitness.</p>
