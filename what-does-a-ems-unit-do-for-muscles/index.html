<p><strong>What Does A Ems Unit Do For Muscles</strong>, While an EMS device may be able to temporarily strengthen tone or firm a muscle no EMS devices have been cleared at this time for weight loss girth. Rather than helping with pain the main function behind an EMS device is to help with muscle growth and recovery. A muscle memory burden can hold them in place which is why they can persist after a muscle cramp has subsided.</p>

<p>However using a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS unit for toning abs or other muscles wont work as it relieves pain by stimulating the nerves without building muscle. Slow-twitch muscle fibers are usually the first to be engaged followed by fast twitch fibers. When an EMS machine stimulates the muscles it helps to increase blood flow to the area in turn decreasing inflammation and encouraging growth.</p>

<p>An electric muscle stimulator often referred to as an EMS machine or unit is an electronic device used to deliver electrical impulses to the body in order to make the muscles contract. EMS devices are effective for muscle building as strength is developed through the process of the muscles contracting then relaxing. If you really want the best of worlds you can treat muscle knots using both TENS and EMS. In the study the EMS unit only produced force less than 20 of the volitional contraction.
