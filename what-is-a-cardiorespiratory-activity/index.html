Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance improves oxygen uptake in the lungs and heart and can help a person sustain physical activity for longer. Increased capacity for delivering oxygen the prevention of stiffening or clogging of the arteries improved functioning of the heart is the process that changes food to energy and builds tissue. The primary measure of CRF is VO 2 max. Coordination isnt a requirement. Pin On Health Activities.</p>
