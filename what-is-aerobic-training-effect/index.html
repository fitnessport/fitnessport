Aerobic conditioning is a process whereby the heart and lungs are trained to pump blood more efficiently allowing more oxygen to be delivered to muscles and organs. Anaerobic power is the ability to produce energy by the ATP-PC energy system and can be assessed with the Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test RAST.
