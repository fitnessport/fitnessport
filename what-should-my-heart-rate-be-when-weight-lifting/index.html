<p><strong>What Should My Heart Rate Be When Weight Lifting</strong>, My HR after a good workout of lifting for an hour and cardio for 40 minutes is usually around 89-95 BPM for an hour or so which is substantially higher than my normal pre-workout resting HR of anywhere from 49-56 BPM on an empty stomach. Lifting weights for less than an hour a week may reduce your risk for a heart attack or stroke by 40 to 70 percent according to a new study. Even during rest my heart rate never goes below 120bpm.</p>
