<p>For example someone following a 16-hour fasting period might decide to eat between noon and 6 pm.

<p>Fasters will have their last meal at the end of the day around 6 pm. For example if you want to build muscle then you might eat a full meal. When it comes to eating after cardio a great post-cardio workout choice is a protein with a veggie carb like a spinach salad with grilled chicken or a piece of salmon with mixed veggies. If you fasted before you trained you should consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates shortly after your workout to promote muscle. By kunitkrzybear in forum Nutrition Replies.
