<p>Home pregnancy tests can sometimes give a false negative result indicating that someone is not pregnant when they are. Start sipping ideally 30 to 45 minutes before you begin exercising and continue to sip on plenty of water during and after your workouts. When a womans period is seven days late she may be pregnant although other things may cause a late or skipped period. Commonly called the morning-after pill medications are available over-the-counter without a prescription that can prevent pregnancy if taken within five days of having unprotected sex. While this is not the start of menopause it is the start of your body beginning to change. Pin On Preggo.</p>
