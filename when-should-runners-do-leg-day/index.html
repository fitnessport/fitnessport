<p><strong>When Should Runners Do Leg Day</strong>, And I suggest you strength train on the same day as a run even on a hard training run day. Another point going against running after leg day is the fact that it is never a good idea to work on the same muscles for two consecutive days. A lazy run for only 24 miles on easy terrain will not be a adequate substitute for leg sessions at your local gym.</p>

<p>A good comprehensive weightlifting program gives you a foundation for any sport including running. You would think that breaking your training sessions up according to body region Leg Day would allow for more recovery between intense workoutsbut if you schedule a heavy leg day followed by a heavy chestback day followed by a heavy abs day your muscles may get a break but your CNS does not.
