<p>I seem to be feeling the squats work out my right leg significantly more than my left leg. Trainees can apply progressive tension overload THE key stimulus to growth on a leg press just as in a squat. Electromygraphic activity was much greater in the lower body with the squat than the leg press. So it seems evident that squats lead to more quad activation than leg presses which is a big deal considering they also lead to higher levels of glute hamstring erector spinae and gastrocnemiussoleus activity. Leg presses didnt exist at least not in any form that wouldnt cripple you and if you wanted to train your legs that pretty much meant squatting.

<p>A recent development has occurred in my squats. Leg press isolates your leg muscles so you can actually start moving tremendous amounts of weight because we all have very strong legs when we dont have to focus on not falling over. Whereas squats work the same muscles as leg press but in addition your core your back and basically your whole upper body as you are trying to stabilize the weight. But its not the right. Squats cause the desired natural anabolic hormonal response favorable to muscle hypertrophy. Squats Vs Leg Press The Ultimate Guide To Better Leg Training.</p>
