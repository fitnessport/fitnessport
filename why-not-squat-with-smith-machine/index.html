The Smith bears some of the weight rather than your abs and back. When you squat down to the bottom and start pushing back up this puts tremendous shearing force through your knee joints. It outshines the smith machine since squats movements are not limited to a vertical path. I know many people are against the Smith but Im not sure why.</p>

<p>But if were talking about focusing on just hitting the quads for size gains then having that weak link makes it inferior to the Smith front squat. And that weak link is eliminated with the Smith machine. When I do squats on the smith machine I start with my legs a few feet out in front of me and go down until I am in a sitting position. This is relevant today because more than one national health club chain does not put squat racks or power racks in their gyms. With the smith you use the sides of the machine for stability by pressing your neck back against the bar. Pin On Work Out Stuff.</p>

<p>The reason is this piece only allows movement in a fixed plane of motion. The Smith machine invented by Jack Lalanne is a weight training equipment containing a barbell fixed between steel rails.
