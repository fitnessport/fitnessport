<p>Alternating between free weights and machines can help you target one specific area like your shoulders says Gottlieb. Machines are far superior to free weights due to the fact that you dont have a specific zone in which you are actually working the desired muscles. In Brad Schoenfelds Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy he states that once people have learned the movement patterns of basic resistance training exercises they should use a variety of exercises to maximise whole-body muscle hypertrophy. But this can also make machines superior if you want to better shift the focus to a single muscle. People are more likely to get injured if the exercises arent done properly thats why people MUST do research so they dont end up ego lifting and ignorantly do each rep and then in the long run build up a false sense of achievement. The Age Old Debate Of Free Weights Versus Machines Continues To Rage On But Does It Really Need To Be Debated.</p>

<p>Other types of resistance such as using resistance bands or your own body weight also can help increase your strength. In Brad Schoenfelds Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy he states that once people have learned the movement patterns of basic resistance training exercises they should use a variety of exercises to maximise whole-body muscle hypertrophy. The bar has 2 hooks on it so you can set the bar the certain height you want it. You can build a lot more strength and muscle size from using weights rather than relying on the machines There are so many muscle and strength advantages that free weights bring. When using these methods its common for one side of the body to become more dominant and take on more of the work in an exercise.

<p>Why are free weights so much better than machines. There is one simple reason that you should be using free weights instead of machines. Benefits of Free Weights Decrease Imbalances- Using weight machines or barbells can lead to strength differences in each side of our body. I see some people at the gym use these machines where you can benchpress or squat. Creativity is important in the weight room because oftentimes addressing weaknesses requires the use of non-traditional movements and movement.
