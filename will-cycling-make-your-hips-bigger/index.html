You can get a bigger butt yet still have narrow hips and when people wonder why they arent wider it will be because this advise doesnt do much to explain the abductor muscles. So yes cycling will change the shape of your legs but unless youre doing a LOT of squats and maintaining the same levels of fat by eating A LOT youre not likely to get bigger. As an aerobic exercise the most cycling would ever do to your legs is tone them and make them look pretty. Does biking make your hips bigger. Pin On Healthy Me.</p>
