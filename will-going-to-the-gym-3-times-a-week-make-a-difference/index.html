<p>Go to the gym three times a week and do 2 of these 3 a different combo each day. Going to the gym 5 times a week or 7 times a week wont make as much of a difference than if you ate lean meat little and healthy carb bananas potatoes etc and lots of veggies less fruit as it usually contains much more sugar.
