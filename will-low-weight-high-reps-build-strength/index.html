<p>The graph below clearly shows that low rep range works best to increase 1-RM. Start with a few weeks of high-volume workouts with lower weight and higher reps which will definitely lead to muscular hypertrophy strengthen your joints and prepare your mind and your body. This 2016 paper by Schoenfeld and colleagues illustrates this idea perfectly. Intuitively there is no single best rep range to build muscle since sets of high reps and low reps have their place in any weight-training program.

<p>At the end of the 24 weeks period those doing the low-load high-repetition strength training increased their bone density BMD significantly while those doing the core strengthening program didnt increase bone density. Although low reps and heavy weights are the only way to get truly strong you can still benefit from including some moderate and high rep sets in your training even if your primary goal is to increase your 1 rep max. High reps using low weight is not the most effective method you can use. If youre doing 10-12 reps make sure its the heaviest weight you can manage for that rep range. Fitness lore dictates that the rep range you choose determines the outcome for your body.
