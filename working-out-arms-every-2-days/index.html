<p>I like the preacher curl but you might prefer the standing barbell curl or hammer curl. It is better not to do the same arm routine two days in a row but you can get away with working the arms at different angles two days in a row such as incline curls and behind the neck triceps extensions on day one and then decline curls and triceps extension pushdowns cable on day two because the biceps and triceps muscles have portions. Since youll be training arms pretty much every other day during weeks three four and five you may be worried about your arms still being sore when you train them. You should not workout more than twice a week for your arms. Your arms are made up of biceps two heads and triceps three heads with Triceps being the bigger muscle.

<p>When you work out the arms exclusively you are actually doing micro damage to those muscles so that the body can then repair them to make them stronger and bigger. Is it good to work out my arms every day. Once youre through Workout 5 you can start over with Workout 1 confident that youre bigger and stronger. Is it overdoing it if I want to do arm exercises everyday. I think both approaches have their proscons.
