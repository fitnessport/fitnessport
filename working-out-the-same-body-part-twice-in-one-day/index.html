<p>Both workouts hit muscles with different movements and reps alter from your conventional 6-8 reps to 10-12 reps in the second split. The two-way split usually works the upper body on the first day and then the lower body on the second day with the third day reserved for rest. Bodybuilders could do bench press in the morning and incline dumbbell presses in the afternoon. I work out 6 times a week m-f on my 45 min lunch and Sunday 1 hour. My main question is since.

<p>Its time to double down and head to the gym. Hit it hard with heavy lifting the first day and then do pump work for the same muscles the next day in the first 15 minutes of the workout. Bodybuilders could do bench press in the morning and incline dumbbell presses in the afternoon. Keep the actual exercises sets and reps the same just split the workout into onetwo body parts in the morning and the other at night. No you can do squats bench press and pull ups in one day But you need to give rest of 48 hours to the same exercise or muscle group to hit again if doing naturally You can grow on 3 day a week kind of workout plan monday wednesday and friday rest in between these days.
